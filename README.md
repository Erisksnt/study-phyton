## About me
Graduate in Cybersecurity 🎓 | Passionate about Networks and Information Security 💻 | Seeking innovative solutions to protect data and systems 🛡️|

I'm Erick, a graduate in Information Security and passionate about Computer Networks and Cybersecurity. 🧠💻

I've worked as a Level 2 Support Analyst, gaining hands-on experience in managing and securing networks in dynamic environments. I'm familiar with tools like Zabbix, Nagios, Grafana, and The Dude, and have worked with routers, switches, firewalls, and RF equipment.

My focus is on keeping systems connected, secure, and running smoothly — making sure data stays safe, available, and reliable. I'm always looking to learn more and apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems in tech. 🚀🔐
